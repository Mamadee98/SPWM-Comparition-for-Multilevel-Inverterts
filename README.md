Simulation results of paper entitled: Comprehensive Investigation on CM  Voltage, Bearing Current, and THD in MLI-fed Motor Drives using SPWM 
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10429069
In this paper six PWM approaches are employed for fivelevel MLI-fed motor drives, and the results were compared.  The three five-level-inverters used are CHB, NPC and PUC, which use PD, POD, APOD, COPD, COPOD and COAPOD SPWM switching methods.
